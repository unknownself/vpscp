VPSCP is a VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER(VPS) control panel(cp). Our goal with VPSCP is to make one of the best and free opensource panels.

Our frontend is designed soley from Bootstrap. We added in jquery/ajax to make it smoother.
With the new advancement, we are finally ready to share v1.0 pre-alpha, there is no install script at this time.

Current v1 pre-alpha features:
Login, view servers, manage server.
Admin area - view configuration and slave count.

We will be pushing updates as we make them.
